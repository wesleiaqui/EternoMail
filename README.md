> **Fork of the original project [Aerion](https://github.com/hkdb/aerion) (v0.3.3) by [hkdb / 3DF](https://3df.io).**
> This fork keeps the original Go module (`github.com/hkdb/aerion`) for internal compatibility and preserves all upstream features, while adding the custom improvements documented below.

### 🔄 Changes from the original project (Aerion)
---

The following changes were made in this fork compared to the original [`hkdb/aerion`](https://github.com/hkdb/aerion) v0.3.3 repository:

#### 🏷️ Rebranding & Visual Identity

| Aspect | Original (Aerion) | This fork (Eterno Mail) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Product name | Aerion | **Eterno Mail** |
| Application identifier | `io.github.hkdb.Aerion` | `io.github.hkdb.EternoMail` |
| Window title (`main.go`) | `"Aerion"` | `"Eterno Mail"` |
| `wails.json` — `companyName` | `3DF` | `Eterno Mail` |
| `wails.json` — `productName` | `Aerion` | `Eterno Mail` |
| CNAME (GitHub Pages) | `aerion.3df.io` | `app.weslleys.com` |
| Desktop entry (`.desktop`) | `Name=Aerion` | `Name=Eterno Mail` |
| Flatpak metainfo | `<name>Aerion</name>` | `<name>Eterno Mail</name>` |
| Linux install icon | `io.github.hkdb.Aerion.png` | `io.github.hkdb.EternoMail.png` |

> **Note:** The executable name (`aerion`), Go module (`github.com/hkdb/aerion`), and frontend `package.json` (`"name": "aerion"`) were kept unchanged to preserve compatibility with internal imports and the build system.

#### 🎨 UI & Visual Improvements

The interface now offers clearer navigation, more consistent spacing and faster access to common actions:

Key visual changes:

- **Sidebar redesign:** Replaced the text-based sidebar with a modern, collapsible navigation for Home, Inbox, Calendar, Archived, Blocked, Drafts, Sent and Trash, plus a collapsible folder panel — cleaner and more space-efficient. Choose Compact, Medium or Large under Settings → General; each preset changes its expanded width, text, icons, row heights and spacing together, and the selected size is preserved after collapsing. Home, Inbox, Calendar and folder icons share a consistent visual axis, while inbox disclosure controls remain in their own column. Compose is a clear primary action, with account sync and Settings grouped in a persistent footer for quick access.
- **Stable scrolling on Linux:** Improved message-list scrolling and scrollbar behavior on WebKitGTK so navigating long lists feels more consistent.
- **Keyboard and startup dialog fixes:** Enter and Space activate focused buttons correctly, and dismissing startup dialogs no longer leaves the interface blocked.
- **Release notes in the app:** The What’s New dialog displays improvements and fixes for the installed version, using the same changelog as the project documentation.
- **Focused folder expansion:** Expanding an account list under a folder closes the other folder groups, keeping the navigation readable.
- **Inbox Zero approach:** The email experience was restructured around the Inbox Zero methodology, helping users keep their inbox organized by encouraging archiving, categorizing, and clearing messages efficiently.
- **Inbox category cards:** Inbox messages can be grouped into People, Notifications, News, Commercial and Read cards. Each card offers a one-click completion action, expandable content and a refined “Show all” footer that highlights the full card footer on hover.
- **Quick message actions:** Hovering a conversation reveals Done, read/unread and delete controls in a fixed left rail without shifting the sender, avatar or message content.
- **Bulk selection controls:** `Ctrl/Cmd+A` toggles the current list selection; selected messages display a compact action bar for completing, archiving or clearing the selection. Read-state changes offer a visible undo action and `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` restores the last explicit read/unread change.
- **Continuous message loading:** Reaching the bottom of the message list automatically loads the next page, replacing the manual “Load more” button with a subtle loading indicator.
- **Settings redesign:** The settings panel was reformulated with a more intuitive and organized layout, making it easier to navigate and configure accounts, appearance, and preferences.
- **Sender logos in conversation list:** Company logos (Google, Discord, Carrefour, etc.) are now displayed alongside contact avatars in the message list, making it easier to visually identify senders at a glance. Falls back to colored initials when no logo is available.
- **Refined conversation list layout:** Improved spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy in the message list for better readability across density modes.
- **Folder organization:** Folders section with dedicated "Snoozed" and "More" options for better mailbox management.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Attachment references during sync:** Updating an existing message preserves its database ID and linked attachments, preventing SQLite foreign-key errors (787).
- **IMAP connection limits:** Connection slots are reserved before the handshake, keeping concurrent connection attempts within the configured limit.
- **Non-selectable mailboxes:** Sync skips status requests for folder containers such as `[Gmail]`, avoiding errors when these containers cannot hold messages.
- **Accurate sync counts:** Sync reports the number of message headers actually stored and no longer counts successful operations as failures.
- **Incremental folder sync:** Rediscovering folders preserves their last flag-sync checkpoint, allowing incremental updates to continue correctly.
- **Archive viewer handoff:** Completing, archiving, deleting or marking spam no longer leaves the conversation viewer displaying an empty removed thread while the list reloads and selects the next valid message.
- **Message moves and Undo:** Moves and Trash actions update the local view promptly, with safer IMAP reconciliation and more reliable Undo handling.
- **Gmail Trash and Spam:** These actions use the account’s correct destination mailboxes.
- **Attachment downloads:** Empty or short message IDs no longer cause a panic, and simultaneous downloads reserve distinct filenames without overwriting each other.

#### 🚀 New Features

- **Sender Logos:** Added a complete caching and display system for company/sender logos in the conversation list:
  - New backend package: `internal/senderlogo` — fetches and stores logos based on the sender's email domain.
  - New frontend store: `frontend/src/lib/stores/senderLogos.svelte.ts` — manages logo state in Svelte.
  - New Wails binding: `app/sender_logo.go` — bridge between backend and frontend.
  - Integration in the `ConversationRow.svelte` component — displays company logo when no contact photo is available.

- **Runtime GTK icon:** Added direct embed of the application icon (`build/appicon.png`) via `//go:embed` in `main.go`, injected as `Icon: appIcon` in the Wails Linux options. This works around icon cache issues in GTK environments (Ubuntu Budgie, Plank dock).

- **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation:** Added full localization support for Brazilian Portuguese, making the application accessible to Portuguese-speaking users.

- **Unified special folders across accounts:** Top-level Drafts, Sent, Trash, Starred, Archived, Spam/Blocked and All Mail views aggregate their matching folders from every enabled account while keeping per-account drill-down available. Gmail-style Archive is handled as a virtual archived view rather than assuming Gmail exposes a physical Archive mailbox.

- **Safer draft lifecycle:** Draft editing resolves canonical draft references, preserves the selected sender identity, keeps attachment edits on the same draft, and prevents Save & Close from closing when the latest content has not been persisted successfully. Detached composer windows hand pending draft synchronization back to the long-lived main process so quick closes do not lose or duplicate drafts.

- **Inbox display modes:** The Inbox can be switched between Priority, Categories and Chronological organization from a compact display picker.

- **Built-in release update checks:** Eterno Mail can check the official GitHub Releases feed in the background, notify when a newer release is available, let users check manually from Settings → About, and allow automatic checks to be disabled.

- **KDE Wayland/X11 titlebar compatibility:** Window decoration handling includes a conservative native-titlebar fallback for KDE/Wayland sessions while preserving the custom titlebar where it behaves correctly.

- **Viewer action tooltips:** Conversation toolbar actions show immediate localized labels on hover or keyboard focus, making icon-only controls easier to understand.

#### 🔒 Privacy & Security Improvements

- **OAuth error-page protection:** Provider error codes and descriptions are escaped before display, preventing callback URLs from injecting HTML or JavaScript.
- **Concurrent OAuth sessions:** Session state is synchronized during login, cancellation and callback handling. Completing an older login no longer clears a newer session.
- **Required SMTP encryption:** Accounts configured for STARTTLS reject servers that do not advertise it, closing the connection before credentials or messages can be sent in plaintext.
- **Safer attachment saving:** Attachment names are sanitized before joining paths, parent-directory traversal is rejected in custom destinations, and writes are confined to the target directory. Save All applies the same filename protection.
- **S/MIME trust verification:** Signatures are checked against system trust roots. Certificates classified as unknown signers are no longer cached; the existing self-signed and expired-certificate exceptions require a valid cryptographic signature.

- **PII redaction in logs:** Implemented `RedactEmail` and `ShortHash` functions in the `internal/logging` package that automatically mask:
  - IMAP/SMTP usernames
  - Email addresses
  - Account names
  - `Message-ID` and `Thread-ID`
  - Email subjects
  - Attachment metadata

#### 🖥️ Platform Robustness

- **Linux container support (Distrobox):** Added safe fallback for D-Bus sleep/wake signals in containerized environments. When the system D-Bus bus is unavailable (e.g., inside Distrobox), the application degrades gracefully instead of crashing.
- **Log noise reduction:**
  - Suppressed timezone push warnings when the calendar extension is disabled.
  - Silenced sender logo fetch attempts for invalid domains.
  - Consolidated FTS startup scans into a single query per folder.

#### ⚡ Performance & Observability Improvements

- **Sync instrumentation:** Added detailed phase-timing to the master sync, enabling monitoring of time spent in each phase:
  - `folder sync`, `LIST/LSUB/STATUS`, `message sync`, `pool wait`
- **Explicit CONDSTORE:** Reasons for full reconcile fallback are now explicitly logged: `below_full_reconcile_threshold`, `no_stored_modseq`, `uidvalidity_changed`, `condstore_unavailable`, `periodic_full_sweep`.
- **FTS optimization:** Full-Text Search startup queries consolidated into a single query per folder, reducing startup overhead.

#### 🗃️ Tests & Database

- **Migration tests:** Added automated tests for upgrade paths V31/V42 → current schema, including integrity and foreign key validation.

### ❓ Why?
---

I was looking for an email app similar to Spark, but I could not find one that felt right for me, so I built Eterno Mail to get the job done. It obviously does not have even 10% of Spark's features, but I enjoy the focused set of features it offers.
