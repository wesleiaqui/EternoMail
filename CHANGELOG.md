# CHANGELOG

## Eterno Mail — v0.3.6

- Improved expanded and compact sidebar sizing, icon alignment, tooltips and the Compose button for clearer navigation.
- Fixed unstable message-list scrolling and scrollbar behavior on Linux/WebKitGTK.
- Made message moves and Trash actions update the local view promptly, with safer IMAP reconciliation.
- Improved Undo reliability when restoring moved messages.
- Fixed Gmail Trash and Spam actions targeting incorrect destination mailboxes.
- Refined conversation-viewer interactions and action feedback.
- Added release notes for the installed version directly to the What's New dialog, using the project's changelog.
- Fixed HTML and JavaScript injection through OAuth callback error codes and descriptions.
- Fixed concurrent OAuth session access during login and cancellation, and prevented an older callback from clearing a newer session.
- Required SMTP STARTTLS connections now close with an error when the server does not offer encryption, preventing plaintext fallback.
- Hardened attachment saving against unsafe filenames, parent-directory traversal and symlinks escaping the destination; Save All sanitizes filenames before building paths.
- Fixed attachment downloads with empty or short message IDs and prevented simultaneous downloads from overwriting the same default filename.
- Added S/MIME verification against system trust roots and stopped caching certificates classified as unknown signers. Existing self-signed and expired-certificate exceptions now require a valid cryptographic signature.

### Security
- `internal/crypto`: device key now uses a versioned format (v2). Existing
  installations with the legacy format (v1) are automatically migrated on
  first startup: all database credentials are transparently re-encrypted with
  the new key derivation — no user action required.
  Legacy v1 support will be removed in Aerion 0.5.0.

## Eterno Mail — v0.3.5

- Fixed first-launch interaction becoming blocked after dismissing the startup dialogs.
- Fixed Enter and Space activation for focused interface buttons.
- Improved startup dialog sequencing and cleanup to prevent stale modal input locks.
- Improved external-link handling in the Terms and OAuth dialogs.
- Updated the What's New dialog to use the actual runtime version.
- Improved Flatpak development builds inside container environments.

## Eterno Mail — v0.3.4

- Added unified Drafts, Sent, Trash, Starred, Archived, Spam/Blocked and All Mail views across enabled accounts.
- Added account-specific special-folder drill-down and Gmail-compatible virtual Archived views.
- Improved draft safety with canonical draft references, sender identity persistence and attachment-safe Save & Close.
- Improved detached composer persistence so quick closes no longer lose or duplicate pending drafts.
- Added automatic background and manual GitHub release update checks.
- Added Priority, Categories and Chronological inbox display selection.
- Added localized tooltips to conversation viewer actions.
- Improved KDE Wayland/X11 titlebar compatibility.
- Updated public project documentation and interface refinements.


## Eterno Mail — v0.3.3 development

- Introduced Eterno Mail branding, public legal documentation and updated public links.
- Refined sidebar navigation, sizing and icon alignment.
- Improved inbox actions, read-state handling and continuous message loading.
- Hardened IMAP pool concurrency and migration test coverage.
